# CVWM Honour Roll Twitter Bot

The CVWM Honour Roll is a Twitter bot derived from [data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/792bb73a-f758-4459-b7e9-0c286a0bc15d) from the [Canadian Virtual War Memorial (CVWM)](https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canadian-virtual-war-memorial) and established to allow all Canadians the opportunity to honour and remember their sacrifices.

This bot is run using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) to make requests to Twitter's API.

This program uses [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to access the `fetch` API directly and [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) to fetch the updated data each day.
